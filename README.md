# PyCon India Social Media and Utility Scripts

Every year in PyCon India we need to automate a lot of stuff specially for Social Media stuff. This repo contains a bunch of utility scripts that can be used to automate Social Media and other tasks.

It contains the following scripts

1. [PyCon India Twitter bot](inpycon-twitterbot)
2. Emailer (TBD)
3. Scraper for CFP (TBD)
